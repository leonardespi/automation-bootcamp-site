## About


I created this site and guide when I received my first promotion to a staff position. At the time, I was both excited and nervous — suddenly responsible for the growth of so many people. So, I built this guide as the kind of mentorship experience I wish I’d had: something clear, practical, and human. It’s meant for my colleagues, peers, and especially my mentees.

A few key notes before you dive in: don’t just read the documentation — **do the exercises!** They’re intentionally designed around the automation demo site to challenge your current understanding and help you grow. And if you ever have questions about the course, please feel free to reach out — I’d love to chat and help however I can.
