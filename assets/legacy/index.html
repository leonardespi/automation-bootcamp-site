<h1>QA Automation Bootcamp: From Zero to Automation Hero\!</h1>

<p>- Return to github → <a href="https://github.com/leonardespi/qa-automation-bootcamp">Here</a></p>

<p>Hello and a <strong>massive welcome</strong> to the QA Automation Bootcamp\! I am so, so excited that you're here. Seriously\! Taking this step is like deciding you're not just going to read books anymore; you're going to learn how to write them. You're about to <strong>unlock a superpower</strong> that will <em><strong>transform your career</strong></em>, and I'm thrilled to be your guide on this adventure.</p>

<p>If you've been working as a <strong>manual or functional tester</strong>, you're already a hero of the software world. You're the <em>guardian of quality</em>, the <em>champion of the user</em>, the one who meticulously checks every nook and cranny to make sure things work as they should. You have an incredible eye for detail and a deep understanding of what makes a product great. But let's be honest, sometimes the work can feel a bit... <strong>repetitive</strong>, right? Clicking the same buttons, filling out the same forms, running through the same checklists day in and day out. It’s like being a world-class chef who only ever gets to chop vegetables. You know you're <strong>capable of so much more</strong>\!</p>

<p>Well, get ready to step into the full kitchen. This course is designed to take your existing expertise and turbocharge it. We're going to teach you how to <strong>build your own team of robot assistants</strong> who can <strong>handle all that repetitive work for you</strong>. Imagine this: instead of spending hours checking every single item on a webpage, you write a script that does it for you in seconds. While your robot assistant is busy running the checks, you can <strong>focus on the fun, creative, and challenging parts of testing</strong>—exploring new features, thinking up tricky edge cases, and making a bigger impact on your team. That’s the <em><strong>magic of automation</strong></em>, and you’re about to become a magician.</p>

<h3>Your Digital Playground: The Automation Tester's Handbook</h3>

<p>Before we dive into <em>how</em> we'll learn, let's talk about <em><strong>where</strong></em> <strong>you'll practice</strong>. Learning to code without a place to apply your skills is like learning to drive a car with no roads. It's all theory and no fun\! That's why we've got the perfect place for you: <a href="http://www.leonardespi.me/automation-testers-handbook-demo/">The Automation Tester's Handbook Demo Website</a>.</p>

<p>Think of this website as your <strong>personal gym for automation</strong>. It's a <strong>purpose-built playground</strong> filled with all the tricky, quirky, and sometimes downright frustrating scenarios that you'll face in the real world. From dynamic tables and pop-up modals to forms that change based on your input, this site is designed to be your sparring partner. It’s a <strong>safe space where you can experiment, make mistakes, and build your confidence</strong>. Every challenge you conquer here is a direct parallel to a problem you'll be able to solve in a real job. We won't just be learning concepts; we'll be <strong>applying them immediately to solve real-world puzzles</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Journey We'll Take Together</h3>

<p>So, how are we going to turn you into an automation pro? We'll do it <strong>one step at a time, building your skills from the ground up</strong>. This isn't about throwing you in the deep end and hoping you can swim. It's a carefully crafted journey where each lesson builds on the last, ensuring you never feel lost or overwhelmed. We'll be using <strong>Python</strong>, one of the most <em>beginner-friendly and powerful programming languages</em> out there, along with <strong>Selenium</strong>, the <em>industry-standard tool for web automation</em>.</p>

<p>Here's our adventure map:</p>
